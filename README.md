# Cuttle

This repository is the full-stack web application for [Cuttle](https://www.cuttle.cards), the pvp card game. The client (front-end) is a Single Page Application (SPA) built in [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) using [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/). The server (back-end) that maintains the API is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application built with [Sails.Js](https://sailsjs.com/get-started). The application is tested end-to-end using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/).

## How To Play

Learn how to play the game by reading the [Game Rules](./docs/game-rules.md).
