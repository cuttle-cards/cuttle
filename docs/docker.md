TODO

1. Run `npm run docker:start` in one tab
2. Run `npm run start:devtools` in another tab (otherwise you'll see 8098 port failures in the console)
3. Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Notes

Postgres isn't being used at the moment in dev, will need to create a docker env most likely for use within docker.
