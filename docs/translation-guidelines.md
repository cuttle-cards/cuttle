# Translation guidelines

Here, we try to determine a terminology for the game of Cuttle that will help future translators.  The goal is to keep the 'Cuttle feel' and have a uniformed terminology throughout the translations.


## The "Cuttle feel"
Some of the terminology refers to the seas and the ocean's depth, but it's not meant to be applied to every term in the game.  Most words used are just standard words used in card games in general. Each language should use words and expressions that feel right to native speakers and not use literal translations with the only goal of using the same word/expression as in the English version.


## Text formatting

- **Capitalize Titles**: Every word in a title must capitalize its first letter (e.g. : "counterTitle": "Chance To Counter" ).

- **Hand** :  The cards a player hold in their hands.
- **Field** :  The area where a player lays their 'active' card.

## Translation guide

- **Scuttle** :  This word is meant to stay the same in every language.  It is used as a noun and a verb in English, but these two uses are not an obligation.  For languages with grammatical genders, the translator may use the one that 'sounds better' in their language.
- **Scrap pile** :  This expression is not meant to transmit the idea of "a pile of junk or old metalic wastes".  So it should be translated to a word that refers to something where you discard - **things that you no longer need.  Many languages have a word for the pile of discarded cards in card games, that word is perfect.
- **To srap a card** :  To get rid of a card by putting it in the scrap pile.  
- **Deck, hand, discard, pick, royal,...** :  Most language already have a specific terminology for card games.  These words should be used.
- **One-off** :  This refers to the idea of an action taking place once with no persistent effect.  If the target language has such a word/expression, it may be used. 
  A basic literal translation (with Google translate) of one-off might sound weird.  In that case, it can be translated to something like "Ability, Effect, super power, ...". 
- **Glasses eight** :  The idea is that a sideways 8 looks like a pair of glasses and glasses give you good vision, therefore allowing you to see you opponent's hand. Ideally this term should be translated to a word for glasses, but if that sounds unnatural in the target language, consider alternatives that convey that this is a card that grants vision
- **Field** :  The field is the area of cards that are in play. Its literal translation might not be of good use, depending on the language.  In French, for example, it wouldn't make much sense to use it. If field doesn't work, use a word that conveys that this is the active area where cards are played.
