# Game Rules

## Players and Cards

Cuttle is a 2-player card game, played with a standard 52 card deck, without jokers. You can read the rules with interactive gif-previews the [rules page](https://www.cuttle.cards/#/rules)

## Goal

The goal is to be the first player to have 21 **or more** points. When a player has 21 or more points, they win immediately and the game is over.

## Setting Up

Each player starts on one side of the game board and is dealt a hand from the deck. One player is dealt six cards; the other is dealt 5 and goes first. A _scrap pile_ area is designated for destroyed cards.

## Playing

On your turn you must make exactly one of the following moves below.

## Moves

1. **Draw:** You may draw one card from the deck and put it in your hand. You may not draw past the 8-card hand-limit. If the deck is empty, you may pass. If three consecutive turns end with a pass, the game is a draw.

   - Click the deck to draw a card

2. **Points:** You may play any number card, Ace-Ten for the number of points shown on the card (Ace is one point). The first player to have 21 **or more** points wins.

   - To play a card for points, click a card in your hand to select it, then click your field.

3. **Scuttling:** You may player a number card from your hand onto a lower valued number card that your opponent has played for points; this destroys both cards. You may also scuttle a card of the same rank, if your card has the higher suit. The suit order is Clubs (weakest) < Diamonds < Hearts < Spades (strongest).

   - To scuttle an opponent's point card, click a higher number card (Ace - Ten) in your hand to select it, then click the card you'd like to scuttle.

4. **Face Cards and Glasses Eights:** Face cards and eights can be played as **Face Cards and Glasses Eights**. While on your board, Face Cards and Glasses Eights provide you advantages. An explanation of the different Face Cards and Glasses Eights can be found below.

   - To play a Face Card or Glasses Eight, click the card in your hand to select it, then click your field (in green) to play it.

5. **One-Offs:** Ace-Sevens and also Nines can be played as **One-Offs**. Playing a card for a One-Off effect discards (to the scrap pile) in exchange for an effect, based on the rank of the card. A list of all the effects can be found below.
   - To play a card as a **One-Off**, click a card in your hand to select it, then click the **Scrap Pile** or an opponent's card to target.

## One-Offs

- **Ace**: Destroy all **Point** cards
- **Two**: One of two effects:
  1. Destroy **target Face Card or Glasses Eight**
  2. Counter **target One-Off** (play this when an opponent plays a **One-Off** effect to stop it from happening)
- **Three**: Choose one card from the **Scrap Pile** and put it in your hand.
- **Four**: Your opponent discards two cards of her choice from her hand to the **Scrap Pile**
- **Five**: Draw two cards from the **Deck**.
- **Six**: Destroy all **Face Cards and Glasses Eights**
- **Seven**: Reveal the top two cards from the **Deck** and choose one of them to play immediately. Play this card however you would like. The other card is placed back on top of the deck.
- **Nine**: Return an opponent's card on the board to their hand. It can't be played next turn.

## Face Cards & Glasses Eights

- **Eight**: While you control an Eight as a **"Glasses Eight"**, your opponent plays with her hand revealed to you. Unlike one-offs, Glasses Eights remain under your control until destroyed.
- **Jack**: Play a jack on top of a **Point Card** to move it to your side of the board. You keep control of the point card as long as you control the top jack.
- **Queen**: While you control a Queen, your other cards cannot be **targeted** by your opponent's cards.
- **King**: While you have a King, the minimum points needed to win is reduced. Each additional King further reduces the limit.
  - 1 King: 14 points to win
  - 2 Kings: 10 points to win
  - 3 Kings: 7 points to win
  - 4 Kings: 5 points to win

## FAQ

### Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle? Can I play a two to destroy my opponent's Face Card or Glasses Eight on her turn?

Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Face Card or Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.

### Do Queens protect against countering with a two?

Yes! Queens protect against **targeting**, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos (either effect), Nines, and Jacks.

### Can I counter a Two with a Two?

Heck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a **One-Off**, which can be **countered** with a two. Stacked counters make for exciting plays.

### Can I win by playing a King?

Yes. If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you play a King when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that turn.

### If I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?

Yes. Aces and Sixes destroy all **Point Cards** and all **Face Cards and Glasses Eights**, respectively. That includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying many of your own cards!

### Where can I play Cuttle?

You can play Cuttle anywhere you have a deck of cards and a friend! If you want to play online, there is only one place: [www.cuttle.cards](https://www.cuttle.cards)
