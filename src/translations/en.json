      "rules": "The rules are otherwise the same as 1v1 Cuttle, with play proceeding clockwise from the left of the dealer, with the following other changes:",
      "rule1": "Each player is dealt 5 cards, play starts left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise from there.",
      "rule2": "Shuffle two Jokers into the deck. Jokers count as Royals with the effect \"Steal target Royal\". Similar to Jacks, they may transfer control of a Royal from any player to any other player.",
      "rule3": "The hand limit is reduced to 7 (from 8).",
      "rule4": "Jacks may be played to transfer control of any point card to any other player. You may therefore \"steal\" points from yourself (or anyone else) in order to give them to your partner, potentially winning on your turn with their points (their goal is still determined by the count of their own Kings on the field).",
      "rule5": "Nines can be played for an alternative, similar effect. Whenever an opponent plays a Royal, you may immediately play a Nine in response to return that card to its owner's hand immediately, preventing its effect from taking place. Doing so may be done out of turn and does not take your turn, but does not prevent the target's owner from playing the card again on their next turn. Alternatively, you may still play a Nine for its original one-off effect on your turn (taking your turn to do so) to return a card to its controller's hand and prevent them from playing that card on their next turn."

      "title": "FAQ",
      "twoCounter": "Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?",
      "twoCounterAnswer": "Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.",
      "queenProtectTwo": "Do Queens protect against countering with a two?",
      "queenProtectTwoAnswer": "Yes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos (either effect), Nines, and Jacks.",
      "queenProtectScuttle": "Do Queens protect against scuttling? What about Aces & Sixes?",
      "queenProtectScuttleAnswer": "No! Scuttling doesn't count as targeting, and neither do the board-wiping effects of Aces or Sixes. Queens only protect against the effects of Twos, Nines, and Jacks.",
      "twoOnTwo": "Can I counter a Two with a Two?",
      "twoOnTwoAnswer": "Heck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a One-Off, which can be countered with a two. Stacked counters make for exciting plays and pivotal strategic moments.",
      "kingWin": "Can I win by playing a King?",
      "kingWinAnswer": "Yes! If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you play a King when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that turn.",
      "aceDestruction": "If I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?",
      "aceDestructionAnswer": "Yes. Aces and Sixes destroy all Point Cards and all Royals plus Glasses Eights, respectively. That includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying too many of your own cards!",
      "revealNoPoints": "My Seven revealed two Jacks and my opponent has no points. What happens?",
      "revealNoPointsAnswer": "If playing both cards revealed by a Seven is impossible (namely revealing two Jacks and your opponent has no point cards in play), choose one card to discard and place the other back on top of the deck.",
      "revealOneLeft": "What if I play a Seven and there is only one card left in the deck?",
      "revealOneLeftAnswer": "Reveal just the one card and continue play like normal. Similar to the above situation, if you reveal a Jack and your opponent does not have any point cards in play, that Jack is scrapped.",
      "emptyHandFive": "What happens when I play a five with an otherwise empty hand?",
      "emptyHandFiveAnswer": "If you have no other cards in hand when you play a 5, you simply skip discarding and draw three cards. This can be a powerful, but risky play. If it works, you end up with two more cards than you started with that turn, but if it is countered, you could have no cards at all!",
      "deckExhaust": "What happens when the deck is exhausted?",
      "deckExhaustAnswer": "When there are no cards left in the deck, players may pass on their turn instead of drawing. If there are three consecutive passes i.e. player 1 passes, player 2 passes, then player 1 passes again, the game ends in a stalemate and neither player wins.",
      "whereToPlay": "Where can I play Cuttle?",
      "whereToPlayAnswer": "You can play Cuttle anywhere you have a deck of cards and a friend. If you want to play online, there is only one place: cuttle.cards"

Becuase the scrap is publically visible, players have always been able to deduce which cards are in their opponent's hands once the deck is exhausted. In order to make gameplay more efficient, players will now be able to see their opponents' hands once the deck is empty. This lets players focus on the strategy, rather than sifting through the scrap. Good luck and have fun!"
