      "rule5": "Nines can be played for an alternative, similar effect. Whenever an opponent plays a Royal, you may immediately play a Nine in response to return that card to its owner's hand immediately, preventing its effect from taking place. Doing so may be done out of turn and does not take your turn, but does not prevent the target's owner from playing the card again on their next turn. Alternatively, you may still play a Nine for its original one-off effect on your turn (taking your turn to do so) to return a card to its controller's hand and prevent them from playing that card on their next turn."

      "title": "FAQ",
      "twoCounter": "Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?",
      "twoCounterAnswer": "Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.",
      "queenProtectTwo": "Do Queens protect against countering with a two?",
      "queenProtectTwoAnswer": "Yes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos (either effect), Nines, and Jacks.",
      "queenProtectScuttle": "Do Queens protect against scuttling? What about Aces & Sixes?",
      "queenProtectScuttleAnswer": "No! Scuttling doesn't count as targeting, and neither do the board-wiping effects of Aces or Sixes. Queens only protect against the effects of Twos, Nines, and Jacks.",
      "twoOnTwo": "Can I counter a Two with a Two?",
      "twoOnTwoAnswer": "Heck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a One-Off, which can be countered with a two. Stacked counters make for exciting plays and pivotal strategic moments.",
      "kingWin": "Can I win by playing a King?",
      "kingWinAnswer": "Yes! If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you play a King when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that turn.",
      "aceDestruction": "If I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?",
      "aceDestructionAnswer": "Yes. Aces and Sixes destroy all Point Cards and all Royals plus Glasses Eights, respectively. That includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying too many of your own cards!",
      "revealNoPoints": "My Seven revealed two Jacks and my opponent has no points. What happens?",
      "revealNoPointsAnswer": "If playing both cards revealed by a Seven is impossible (namely revealing two Jacks and your opponent has no point cards in play), choose one card to discard and place the other back on top of the deck.",
      "revealOneLeft": "What if I play a Seven and there is only one card left in the deck?",
      "revealOneLeftAnswer": "Reveal just the one card and continue play like normal. Similar to the above situation, if you reveal a Jack and your opponent does not have any point cards in play, that Jack is scrapped.",
      "emptyHandFive": "What happens when I play a five with an otherwise empty hand?",
      "emptyHandFiveAnswer": "If you have no other cards in hand when you play a 5, you simply skip discarding and draw three cards. This can be a powerful, but risky play. If it works, you end up with two more cards than you started with that turn, but if it is countered, you could have no cards at all!",
      "deckExhaust": "What happens when the deck is exhausted?",
      "deckExhaustAnswer": "When there are no cards left in the deck, players may pass on their turn instead of drawing. If there are three consecutive passes i.e. player 1 passes, player 2 passes, then player 1 passes again, the game ends in a stalemate and neither player wins.",
      "whereToPlay": "Where can I play Cuttle?",
      "whereToPlayAnswer": "You can play Cuttle anywhere you have a deck of cards and a friend. If you want to play online, there is only one place: cuttle.cards"

    "ruleInfo": "Playing a 5 now has a revised one-off effect: discard a card, then draw three cards ",
    "whyImplementHeader": "Why are we implementing this?",
    "whyImplement": "Because 5's take your turn to play and you could alternatively draw a card on your turn, while playing a 5 feels like it gets you two cards (yay!) it effectively only replaces itself without doing anything else for you. In order to power up the five and give it a specific purpose, while leaning into the theme of cycling your hand to draw you lots of cards, we're experimenting with a variation on the 5's effect where you first discard a card from your hand, then draw three cards! We hope this will increase the usefulness of the 5's effect and hone its strategic function. And we need your help deciding if this should become a permanent change!",
    "previousBetaHeader": "Have we tested this before?",
    "previousBeta": "We previously ran a 2-week beta trialing recycler 5's back in April. The community voted and the result was 69% to 31% in favor of the change. We got some valuable feedback, most importantly that many players felt they would like more time to trial recycler 5's before a final decision is made. We care deeply about respecting the community's wishes and about being thoughtful and conservative about making any changes to the rules of the game. In that spirit, we are extending the recycler 5 beta through the Diamonds 2024 Cuttle Season Championship!",
