        <p class="d-block">
          The goal is to be the first player to have 21 or more points worth of point cards on your
          field. The first player to reach the goal wins immediately. One player (traditionally the
          dealer) is dealt 6 cards, and their opponent is dealt 5. The player with 5 cards goes
          first.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Presently only 2-player cuttle is available at
          <a href="https://www.cuttle.cards"> www.cuttle.cards</a>, however Cuttle can be played
          with 2-4 players. 3 and 4-player Cuttle each have slight variations on the rules to
          optimize the game balance while changing the pace and the feel. Give them a try next time
          you're playing Cuttle in a group!
        </p>
        <h3>3 Player Cuttle: Cutthroat</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cutthroat is a brutally fast-paced 1v1v1 version of Cuttle, full of betrayal and pivotal
          moments!
        </p>
        <p>The rules are the same as above with the following changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The win condition is reduced. Players need 14 points to win by default, 9 points with
            one king in play, 5 points with two kings in play, and having 3 kings in play
            immediately wins (goal becomes zero).
          </li>
          <li>
            To start play, deal each player 5 cards and the player to the left of the dealer goes
            first. Which player is the delete rotates clockwise each game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shuffle two jokers into the deck. Joker's count as Royals with the effect "Steal target
            Royal".
          </li>
          <li>The hand limit is reduced to 7 (from 8).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4 Player Cuttle: 2v2</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          4 player Cuttle is a 2v2 team game. Each player sits across from their partner. Your team
          wins if either you or your teammate reach your respective goals, but players do not share
          cards on their hand or field (points are counted separately and your royals do not
          directly affect your partner).
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules are otherwise the same as 1v1 Cuttle, with play proceeding clockwise from the
          left of the dealer, with the following other changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each player is dealt 5 cards, play starts left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise from
            there
          </li>
          <li>
            Shuffle two jokers into the deck. Joker's count as Royals with the effect "Steal target
            Royal". Similar to jacks, they may transfer control of a royal from any player to any
            other player.
          </li>
          <li>The hand limit is reduced to 7 (from 8).</li>
          <li>
            Jacks may be played to transfer control of any point card to any other player. You may
            therefore "steal" points from yourself (or anyone else) in order to give them to your
            partner, potentially winning on your turn with their points (their goal is still
            determined by the count of their own kings on the field).
          </li>
          <li>
            Nine's can be played for an alternative, similar effect. Whenever an opponent plays a
            royal, you may immediately play a nine in response to return that card to its owner's
            hand immediately, preventing its effect from taking place. Doing so may be done out of
            turn, does not take your turn, but does not prevent the target's owner from playing the
            card again on their next turn. Alternatively, you may still play a nine for it's
            original one-off effect on your turn (taking your turn to do so) to return a card
            permanently to it's controller's hand and prevent them from playing that card on their
            next turn.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <v-row class="d-flex flex-column mb-4">
        <h1 class="gradient-text">FAQ</h1>
        <h3>Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses
          Eight, but this takes your turn, unlike countering.
        </p>
        <h3>Do Queens protect against countering with a two?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific
          card. This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos
          (either effect), Nines, and Jacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Do Queens protect against scuttling? What about Aces & Sixes?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          No! Scuttling doesn't count as targeting, and neither do the board-wiping effects of Aces
          or Sixes. Queens only protect against the effects of Twos, Nines, and Jacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I counter a Two with a Two?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Heck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a One-Off, which can be countered with a two.
          Stacked counters make for exciting plays and pivotal strategic moments.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I win by playing a King?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes! If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you
          play a King when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that
          turn.
        </p>
        <h3>If I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes. Aces and Sixes destroy all Point Cards and all Royals plus Glasses Eights,
          respectively. That includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying too many of
          your own cards!
        </p>
        <h3>Where can I play Cuttle?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You can play Cuttle anywhere you have a deck of cards and a friend! If you want to play
          online, there is only one place:
