          The goal is to be the first player to have 21 or more points worth of point cards on your field. The
          first player to reach the goal wins immediately. One player (traditionally the dealer) is dealt 6
          cards and their opponent is dealt 5. The player with 5 cards goes first.

      <v-row class="d-flex flex-column mb-4">
        <h1 class="gradient-text">Multiplayer Variants</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Presently only 2-player cuttle is available at
          <a href="https://www.cuttle.cards"> www.cuttle.cards</a>, however Cuttle can be played with 2-4
          players. 3 and 4-player Cuttle each have slight variations on the rules to optimize the game balance
          while changing the pace and the feel. Give them a try next time you're playing Cuttle in a group!
        </p>
        <h3>3 Player Cuttle: Cutthroat</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Cutthroat is a brutally fast-paced 1v1v1 version of Cuttle, full of betrayal and pivotal moments!
        </p>
        <p>The rules are the same as above with the following changes:</p>
        <ul class="mb-4">
          <li>
            The win condition is reduced. Players need 14 points to win by default, 9 points with one King in
            play, 5 points with two Kings in play, and having 3 Kings in play immediately wins (goal becomes
            zero).
          </li>
          <li>
            To start play, deal each player 5 cards and the player to the left of the dealer goes first. Which
            player is the dealer rotates clockwise each game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shuffle two Jokers into the deck. Jokers count as Royals with the effect "Steal target Royal".
          </li>
          <li>The hand limit is reduced to 7 (from 8).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4 Player Cuttle: 2v2</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          4 player Cuttle is a 2v2 team game. Each player sits across from their partner. Your team wins if
          either you or your teammate reach your respective goals, but players do not share cards on their
          hand or field (points are counted separately and your Royals do not directly affect your partner).
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules are otherwise the same as 1v1 Cuttle, with play proceeding clockwise from the left of the
          dealer, with the following other changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each player is dealt 5 cards, play starts left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise from there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shuffle two Jokers into the deck. Jokers count as Royals with the effect "Steal target Royal".
            Similar to Jacks, they may transfer control of a Royal from any player to any other player.
          </li>
          <li>The hand limit is reduced to 7 (from 8).</li>
          <li>
            Jacks may be played to transfer control of any point card to any other player. You may therefore
            "steal" points from yourself (or anyone else) in order to give them to your partner, potentially
            winning on your turn with their points (their goal is still determined by the count of their own
            Kings on the field).
          </li>
          <li>
            Nines can be played for an alternative, similar effect. Whenever an opponent plays a Royal, you
            may immediately play a Nine in response to return that card to its owner's hand immediately,
            preventing its effect from taking place. Doing so may be done out of turn and does not take your
            turn, but does not prevent the target's owner from playing the card again on their next turn.
            Alternatively, you may still play a Nine for its original one-off effect on your turn (taking your
            turn to do so) to return a card to its controller's hand and prevent them from playing that card
            on their next turn.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <!-- FAQ -->
      <v-row class="d-flex flex-column mb-4">
        <h1 class="gradient-text">FAQ</h1>
        <h3>Can I play a two to counter a point card? What about a scuttle?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Nope! Twos can only counter One-Offs. You can play a two to destroy a Royal or Glasses Eight, but
          this takes your turn, unlike countering.
        </p>
        <h3>Do Queens protect against countering with a two?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes! Queens protect against targeting, when a card applies a unique effect to one specific card.
          This means your other cards (not the Queen, herself) are protected against Twos (either effect),
          Nines, and Jacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Do Queens protect against scuttling? What about Aces & Sixes?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          No! Scuttling doesn't count as targeting, and neither do the board-wiping effects of Aces or Sixes.
          Queens only protect against the effects of Twos, Nines, and Jacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I counter a Two with a Two?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Heck yeah! Playing a Two to counter is a One-Off, which can be countered with a two. Stacked
          counters make for exciting plays and pivotal strategic moments.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I win by playing a King?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes! If you meet the required number of points, you win immediately. This means if you play a King
          when you already have enough points to meet the new limit, you win on that turn.
        </p>
        <h3>If I play an Ace or a Six, are my cards destroyed as well?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Yes. Aces and Sixes destroy all Point Cards and all Royals plus Glasses Eights, respectively. That
          includes any that you have out. Try to avoid destroying too many of your own cards!
        </p>
        <h3>My Seven revealed two Jacks and my opponent has no points. What happens?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If playing both cards revealed by a Seven is impossible (namely revealing two Jacks and your
          opponent has no point cards in play), choose one card to discard and place the other back on top of
          the deck.
        </p>
        <h3>What if I play a Seven and there is only one card left in the deck?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Reveal just the one card and continue play like normal. Similar to the above situation, if you
          reveal a Jack and your opponent does not have any point cards in play, that Jack is scrapped.
        </p>
        <h3>Where can I play Cuttle?</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You can play Cuttle anywhere you have a deck of cards and a friend! If you want to play online,
          there is only one place:
